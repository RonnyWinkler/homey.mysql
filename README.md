# MySQL for Homey

Access your SQL database from Homey.

Use SQL syntax in your flow actions to write capability values to your database for logging.
Read single or SUM/AVG values with SQL systax in a flow action and retrieve the value as flow trigger to use it in homey - perhaps to store it in a virtual sensor.
